# What is Parallax Scrolling ? #

Parallax scrolling is quite simple technique that was heavily used in games of the 80th and 90th, like Turrican, R-Type, Shadow of the Beast, Silkworm, Golden Axe, Mario Bros. and so on and so forth.
To achieve the impression of depth in a 2D environment several partially opaque images are layered and each of them moves with different horizontal and/or vertical translation speed. Usually, the layers considered far away move slowwer than layers considered close to the viewer.
